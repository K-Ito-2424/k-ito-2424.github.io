abstract: >-
  This presentation explored an engineering approach to identify and analyze language
  that reflects various aspects of well-being. By integrating computational linguistics
  with psychological perspectives, we examined how linguistic patterns can serve as indicators
  of individual and collective well-being. The study discussed implications for AI systems that
  aim to promote social and emotional health.

summary: >-
  An interdisciplinary study that applies computational linguistics to explore linguistic indicators
  of well-being within the context of GenAI and social impact.
